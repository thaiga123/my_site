                Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m AJ, a curious mind with a passion for coding, learning, and making the most of every day. Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

            <h2>What I'm All About</h2>
            <p>
                Iâ€™ve completed my Python course and am now diving even deeper into the language. Iâ€™m using my knowledge to build real-world projectsâ€”like this very website! Along the way, Iâ€™ve also become familiar with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>HTML and CSS</b> - for crafting beautiful websites.</li>
                <li><b>JavaScript and MySQL</b> - which I'm currently learning to enhance my web development and project-building skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I code daily, keep exploring, and love discovering new tools and techniques to expand my knowledge.
