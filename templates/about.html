        <p class="block">
            Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m AJ, a curious mind with a passion for coding, learning, and making the most of every day. 
            Welcome to my little corner of the internet!</p>

    <h2 class="heading">What I'm all about</h2>
        <p class="block">
            Iâ€™ve completed my Python course and am now diving even deeper into the language. Iâ€™m using my knowledge 
            to build real-world projectsâ€”like this very website! <br>Along the way, Iâ€™ve also become familiar with:
        </p>

    <ul class="block">
        <li><b>HTML and CSS</b>-for crafting beautiful websites.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript and MySQL</b>-which I'm currently learning to enhance my web development and
            project-building skills.</li>
    </ul>
    
        <p class="block">I code daily, keep exploring, and love discovering new tools and techniques to expand my knowledge.</p>
        
    <h2 class="heading">My Interests</h2>
    <p class="block" style="font-size:18px">When I'm not coding, you'll find me:</p>

    <ul class="block">
        <li>Watching videos about <b>tech, cybersecurity, and AI</b>
            â€”topics that keep me inspired and informed.</li>
        <li>Playing <b>chess</b> â€“ a game I enjoy to relax and sharpen my
            strategic thinking.</li>
        <li>Listening to music â€“ I love a variety of genres, from
            classical to modern hits.</li>
        <li>Improving my <b>productivity</b> and learning how to
            make the most out of each day.</li>
        <li><b>Working out</b>, staying active, and challenging myself
            physically.</li>
        <li>Spending time with my <b>dog</b>, who never fail to
            brighten my day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heading">Why I Build This Website</h2>
    <p class="block">This website is a reflection of who I am and what I love doing. Itâ€™s a space to share my journey in coding, ethical<br>
        hacking, and personal growth while connecting with like-minded individuals. Whether youâ€™re here to learn, explore,<br>
