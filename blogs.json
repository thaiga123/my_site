        "title": "From Scambaiting Videos to Coding: My Journey",
        "content": "My journey into coding began with a simple yet impactful inspiration\u2014scambaiting videos. Back then, I spent countless hours watching videos of scambaiters who hacked scammers, exposing their malicious schemes. The thrill of using technology to outsmart the bad guys caught my attention, and I found myself deeply motivated to become an ethical hacker one day.\r<br>\r<br>The Beginning: Searching for Answers\r<br>Curious to know how one becomes an ethical hacker, I started searching for tutorials and videos on what programming languages hackers should know. Among all the options, Python stood out to me as a versatile and powerful language that is often associated with ethical hacking. I quickly realized that Python was a gateway to understanding cybersecurity, scripting, and automation\u2014key skills for an aspiring ethical hacker.\r<br>\r<br>A False Start on Mobile\r<br>Back then, I didn\u2019t have a laptop, so I turned to my phone and a website called Python Compiler to get started. I spent some time watching Python tutorial videos, practicing basic concepts, and experimenting with code snippets. However, it didn\u2019t feel quite \u201cofficial\u201d on my phone, and I eventually quit. It wasn\u2019t until early 2024 that my path took a more structured turn.\r<br>\r<br>KMS College and New Opportunities\r<br>In early 2024, KMS College held a learnership in our town, covering topics that piqued my interest\u2014AI, cybersecurity, and data analytics. I joined the course, hoping to gain more knowledge and hands-on experience in these fields. During the course, I had the chance to speak to one of the teachers about my Python studies, even though I had given up previously. He encouraged me to keep going, highlighting the power of Python and noting that it was still relatively new in our country, South Africa. His words reignited my motivation, and I decided to convince my parents to buy me a laptop to aid my learning journey.\r<br>\r<br>A Fresh Start with a New Tool\r<br>When my laptop finally arrived, I felt more like a \u201creal\u201d coder. I dived back into Python with renewed enthusiasm, and the more I coded, the more I enjoyed it. I purchased an online course from PythonX, a simple app from the Play Store called \"Learn Python.\" It was an affordable option at just R150, yet it provided me with a wealth of knowledge. Along with Python, I started exploring additional areas like MySQL, Tkinter, and HTML/CSS. Today, I have a solid foundation in these technologies and am actively learning JavaScript.\r<br>\r<br>A New Passion Emerges\r<br>Though my main goal remains becoming an ethical hacker one day, I\u2019ve developed a deep love for coding and web development along the way. The more I delve into the world of programming, the more I realize how these skills can complement my aspirations in cybersecurity. I\u2019m excited about the possibilities that coding offers\u2014not just for ethical hacking but also for creating and building my own projects in web development.\r<br>\r<br>This journey has been a mix of ups and downs, but every challenge has only fueled my passion to keep learning and growing. Python might be the language that started it all, but now, I\u2019m exploring new horizons and discovering the joy of coding along the way.",

        "title": "How Coding Changed My Life and My Way of Thinking",
        "content": "Coding has profoundly transformed not just my skills but also my perspective on life and the world around me. Before I began learning to code, I viewed problems as isolated issues with no clear solutions. I approached tasks in a straightforward manner, often opting for the easiest path without considering alternatives. But coding introduced me to a whole new way of thinking\u2014logical, structured, and problem-solving-oriented.\r<br>\r<br>When I started to code, I found myself breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This not only made the coding process easier but also changed the way I approached real-world challenges. Now, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the magnitude of a problem, I take a systematic approach\u2014analyzing, planning, and executing. This methodical thinking extends to other areas of my life as well, helping me tackle obstacles in a more organized manner.\r<br>\r<br>Coding has also instilled a sense of curiosity and creativity. Every line of code is like a puzzle to solve, a challenge to overcome. It\u2019s taught me to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them\u2014skills that are invaluable in both my personal and professional life. I\u2019m no longer afraid to fail because I understand that failure is just a step towards finding a better solution.\r<br>\r<br>Moreover, coding has broadened my horizons by exposing me to different cultures, ideas, and technologies from around the world. It\u2019s a universal language that allows me to connect with people I would otherwise never have met. This global perspective has deepened my understanding of diverse viewpoints and has made me more open-minded and empathetic.\r<br>\r<br>In essence, coding has changed the way I think and see the world. It has made me more analytical, creative, and adaptable. And most importantly, it\u2019s empowered me to approach problems with a positive attitude, knowing that every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow.",
